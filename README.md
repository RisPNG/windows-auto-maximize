# Windows Auto Maximize
A Windows utility that automatically adjusts window sizes based on screen resolution.

## Behaviour
1) If a window size covers 95% or more of the total resolution it auto-maximizes it.
2) If you unmaximize a window and it's still over 95%, it will be resized to 70% and centered.
3) Any other scenarios regarding window sizes will not be affected.

## Why?
There's a 100% chance that everyone that has used Windows experienced an awkward (near-)fullscreen windows and thinking they're already in fullscreen. So clicking the (un)maximize button won't do anything since the unmaximized state of the window is already the (near-)fullscreen size. This utility avoids that by giving you the functionality that provides the clarity.
